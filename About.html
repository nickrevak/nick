  <span> ABOUT US
I first started making videos of average golfers side-by-side with a pro way back in 1979.  Working out of a friends driving range with an Amiga computer and a Panasonic camcorder, I created “Pro Motion Video”.  This was before Windows, before the Internet, and before cell phones.  Ant therein lay the problem to my idea … I had to go to a range, take the video, and create the tape.  It simply was too labor intensive and i had a real job and there just wasn’t enough time to devote to my idea.  I did try to patent my idea but was told by an attorney that it would take $10,000 just to find out if it was patentable.  I stopped pursuing my idea for over 30 years.  But now, with advancement in technologies over the years, the time for my original idea is right.  Golfers can take their own video with their cell phone, upload it to my web site and receive the results via the Internet.   Hence …. Low Tech Golf, help for the average golfer.
